Single page application to display my recent work, built with AngularJS. No jQuery, no sliders, no parallax, no shit. The app features a nice grid view, project pages, a timeline and a RSS reader to show post from my blog. Did I tell you that it's fully optimized for search engines? Meta descriptions get automatically loaded. To get this magic to work, I use PhantomJS to prerender pages for crawlers.
